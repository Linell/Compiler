CSC408 - Programming Languages

This is a 'compiler' built by Dr. Dia Ali that I have modified.
It really only checks the syntax of a file that is passed in. It
supports several different expressions, and it's pretty darn cool.
Please keep in mind that while this code *has* been heavily
modified, the lack of pythonic style seen here is not my doing. I
might change it one day in the future, but we'll see about that.

	Currently, the compiler is set up to print the output to a file.
	I've left the code in to change it back though, so that you can
	switch it back rather easily.

Features I'd Like to Implement:
*	Make it more robust in the area of being able to easily input files. This is pretty simple, BUT, I'd also like to have it set to default to a certain file if there's no input.
*	More pythonic style. I mean, c'mon. All those globals.
