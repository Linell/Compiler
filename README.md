# CSC 408 and 415 #

This is a 'compiler' built by Dr. Dia Ali that I have modified.
It really only checks the syntax of a file that is passed in. It
supports several different expressions, and it's pretty darn cool.
Please keep in mind that while this code *has* been heavily
modified, the lack of good style seen here is not (completely) my doing. I
might change it one day in the future, but we'll cross that bridge when
we get there.

Currently, the python compiler is set up to print the output to a file.
I've left the code in to change it back though, so that you can
switch it back rather easily.

The C++ compiler is still in its *very* early stages of modification and currently does not support any of the nifty features of the python compiler. In fact, the C++ file is _way_ behind.
