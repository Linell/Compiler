CSC408 - Programming Languages

This is a 'compiler' built by Dr. Dia Ali that I have modified.
It really only checks the syntax of a file that is passed in. It
supports several different expressions, and it's pretty darn cool.

Features I'd Like to Implement:
*	Better error checking.
	- I've definitely improved the checking that it's doing, but I'd like line counting and a better explanation of what each error is on.
*	Make it more robust in the area of being able to easily input files. This is pretty simple, BUT, I'd also like to have it set to default to a certain file if there's no input.

For those features...we'll see.
